# SpyPip - Python Packaging PR Analyzer

<img src="logo.png" alt="SpyPip Logo" width="200">

SpyPip is a tool that analyzes GitHub repositories to find open pull requests that touch Python packaging files and provides AI-powered summaries of packaging-related changes.

## Features

- üîç **Smart Detection**: Automatically identifies PRs that modify packaging files (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, setup.py, Dockerfiles, etc.)
- ü§ñ **AI Summaries**: Uses OpenAI GPT to generate concise summaries of packaging changes
- üìä **Comprehensive Analysis**: Analyzes dependencies, build configurations, containerization changes, and version constraints
- üîó **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with GitHub API via MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- üß† **Reasoning Model Support**: Compatible with reasoning models that include thinking steps in responses

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmilienM/spypip.git
cd spypip
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables:

**Option A: Using .env file (recommended)**
```bash
# Copy the example file and edit it with your values
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your favorite editor
nano .env
```

**Option B: Using shell environment variables**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-github-token"
# Optional: Override the default OpenAI endpoint
export OPENAI_ENDPOINT_URL="https://your-custom-inference-server.com"
```

## Usage

Run SpyPip by specifying the repository you want to analyze:

```bash
python -m spypip owner/repository-name
```

For example:
```bash
python -m spypip vllm-project/vllm
```

## Output

SpyPip will:

1. Fetch all open pull requests from the specified repository
2. Identify PRs that modify packaging files
3. Generate AI-powered summaries for each relevant PR
4. Display a comprehensive report showing:
   - PR details (number, title, author, URL)
   - Changed packaging files with statistics
   - AI analysis of packaging implications

## Environment Variables

SpyPip supports loading environment variables from `.env` files. It searches for `.env` files in the following order:
1. Current working directory
2. User's home directory
3. Project root directory

**Required Variables:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Required for AI summary generation
- `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Required for GitHub API access

**Optional Variables:**
- `OPENAI_ENDPOINT_URL`: Override the default OpenAI inference server URL (defaults to `https://models.github.ai/inference`)
- `MODEL_NAME`: Specify the model to use for AI analysis (defaults to `openai/gpt-4.1`)

**Note:** Environment variables set in your shell will take precedence over those in `.env` files.

## Reasoning Model Support

SpyPip includes built-in support for reasoning models that include thinking or reasoning steps in their responses. These models often wrap their internal reasoning in tags such as:

- `<thinking>...</thinking>`
- `<reasoning>...</reasoning>`
- `<analysis>...</analysis>`
- `<internal_thought>...</internal_thought>`

SpyPip automatically detects and extracts only the final response, filtering out the reasoning steps to provide clean, actionable summaries. This ensures compatibility with both standard and reasoning-based language models without any additional configuration.
The tool will automatically handle the response parsing regardless of whether the model includes reasoning steps or not.

## Dependencies

- `openai`: For AI-powered analysis
- `mcp`: Model Context Protocol for GitHub integration
- `python-dotenv`: For loading environment variables from .env files
- Standard library modules for async operations and data handling
